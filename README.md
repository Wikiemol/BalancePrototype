Description
-----------
This is a prototype I made for a game idea I had for android. 
The goal is to balance a stack of bricks and to make your stack as high as possible without losing all of your health.

How to Play
-----------

- Use the mouse to move
- Space slows time and freezes your stack, but makes you lose health
- Whenever you let a bar drop, you use health. The amount of health you use is equal
  to the length of the bar (i.e., the bigger the bar, the more health you lose)
- Health bar is at the top
- Try to get to the top without losing all your health
